      <h1>High drama on high seas: 6 women navy officers circumnavigating the globe share their crazy experiences</h1>
      <h4>First All Women Team In Navy...(Their Experince)</h4>
      <p>“We should have a cool pseudonym. Something like… The Gulls,” one muses out loud, seeming quite satisfied with herself.<br>
“What, like, a Punjabi way of saying girls?” said some other, genuinely confused.<br>
“No, fool – like Seagulls. We are women at sea, get it?” clarifies the former, somewhat heartbroken.<br>
“What about No?” the latter says Jokingly.<br>
What I accidentally eavesdropped on, as Lt. Cdr. Vartika Joshi and Lt. Aishwarya Boddapati miced up for the women's day gala hosted by SHM Shipcare at their Shipyard in Thane, was, in fact, the quintessence of the bonhomie six women officers had come to share, united by the blues – of torrents, and trials of spirit.<br>
<b>In sea, their differences make way for kinship. At sea, ranks dissipate, and thanks emerge. That is a perfect union, for unlike our land, the sea knows no gender, and these women know no limits.</b><br>
As they gear up for the voyage of a lifetime, commissioned by the navy as the first all-women team of Navy officers to circumnavigate the globe non-stop this August, two officers present at that event, from that one-of-a-kind team -- constituting skipper Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi, and crew members Lieutenant Commander Pratibha Jamwal, Lieutenant Aishwarya Boddapati, Lieutenant Patarapalli Swathi, Lieutenant Sh Vijaya Devi and Lieutenant Payal Gupta – Their Stories.</p><br><br>

<h3>Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi</h3>
<p>She was born in the hilly terrains of Garhwal in Uttarakhand. But she has spent half of her formative years in Rishikesh, for each of her parents held jobs as teachers at either location. Her early memories are ruled by the tides, and embracing the rapids has been one of her primal instincts. And yet – this Naval architect had been kept from the sea her entire life. She was desperately trying to get close to the sea. She did not like being constrained by four walls. <br>
She took up aerospace engineering because aviation was more compelling and challenging.But, in aerospace,she know very well that if you don't procure a master's degree, there is very little scope. At that time, some navy officials visited her college for the university entry scheme, to select a few individuals who could appear for the Service Selection Board (SSB), and eventually get recruited.Since She was a nature and adventure lover, and wanted to see the ocean, she applied and got selected fortunately.<br>
Lt. Cdr. Vartika opted for a branch called naval construction, which entailed designing and construction of ships. <b>When she joined the navy in 2010, She wasn't recruited as a 'woman'. The best thing about the forces is that they do not define you by your gender.</b> Same goes for the sport of sailing, it is not gender biased. It's challenging physically and mentally, and fosters a great rapport between anyone. The greatest enemies on land tend to become friends at sea. It's a wonderful thing.<br>
</p><br>

<h3>Lieutenant Aishwarya Boddapati</h3>
<p>She was Born and raised in Hyderabad, She’s father worked with the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), and so, she did her entire schooling from an air force station, in increasing awe of the uniform; but not in a way that she coveted someone in uniform – she saw herself in one.<br>
She was always attracted to the uniform. That's how she joined the navy. As for sailing, it was destiny. Every time she travelled, adventure sports were a must. So, joining the armed forces is the best thing She has ever done – because here, this was to become her whole life . She also came on board as a Naval Constructor. Her basic training took place in the Andamans.<br>
However, during her first expedition to Mauritius – she had no idea what awaited at the land's end. She was completely raw and unaware of what was in store for her. She was just excited that She is going to Mauritius.<br>
Her first voyage not only provided her heart's fill of adventure, but also delivered a jolting reality check about life at sea. “We left in the monsoons – there was this night, and she was on watch. She was learning slowly, and it started raining like crazy. When it rains, we have to lower our speed, and take down the sails. Because it was pouring, there was no time to go put on a raincoat; She had to rush to take control. She was just hanging on for dear life, drenched to my bones, and She had this moment, where She burst out laughing and told myself,<b> in the middle of nowhere, sea till as far as She could see – “What have She gotten herself into! This is not an adventure – it's life-threatening!”</b><br>
